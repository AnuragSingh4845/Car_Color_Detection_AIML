#Color Detection of Car using Machine Learning
This GitHub repository contains a collection of code files and resources related to color detection of cars using machine learning techniques. The aim of this project is to develop a robust and accurate system that can identify the color of cars in images or video streams.

Features
Machine Learning Models: The repository includes various machine learning models implemented in popular frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. These models are trained on large datasets of car images with labeled colors to enable accurate color detection.

Dataset: The repository provides a curated dataset of car images, each labeled with the corresponding color. This dataset is used for training and evaluating the machine learning models, ensuring reliable performance.

Preprocessing Techniques: The code in this repository encompasses preprocessing techniques for handling and augmenting the dataset. These techniques include image resizing, color space conversions, and data augmentation to enhance model performance and generalization.

Inference Scripts: The repository includes scripts for deploying the trained models to perform color detection on new images or video streams. These scripts can be easily customized and integrated into your own projects.

Evaluation and Metrics: The repository contains evaluation scripts to measure the accuracy and performance of the color detection models. Metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score are computed to assess the effectiveness of the models.
